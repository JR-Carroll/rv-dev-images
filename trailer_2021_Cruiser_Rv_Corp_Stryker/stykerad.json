        REDUCED PRICE!!

        Live and Learn! Should have gotten the 5th wheel. Our mistake is your gain!

        We literally just purchased this RV 1 month ago. It still has the temporary tag for the license plate as it is so new that we have not even registered it yet!

        This is a brand new 2021 Cruisers Stryker 2613 Toy Hauler that has every available option! We've used it a few times and decided that a larger 5th wheel toy hauler will work better for our family. This is an awesome RV, it's just not the right fit for us.

        Upgrades and Options include:
        Onan 5500 watt generator with 50 amp electrical service - You'll find that other RV's of this type only come with the smaller Onan 4000 watt generator and 30 amp service.

        2 air conditioning units. The main AC unit is upgraded from 13.5k to 15.0k. The master bedroom has its own 13.5k unit. - You will find that other RV's of this type only have a single 13.5k unit that won't cut it in the summer heat.

        Electric stabilizing system - You will find other RV's of this type have manual scissor jacks on each corner that you have to use a cordless drill to raise and lower.

        Upgraded toilet - I removed the cheap plastic \"training potty\" that comes with these RV's and upgraded to a full size porcelain toilet with elongated bowl. Guys, you know what I'm talking about here!

        I also replaced the cheap plastic faucet and shower head with a nice brass sink faucet, and shower head that is fully adjustable for height and angle. I'm 6'3\" so I needed the shower head to be higher, but the wife and kids need the head lower.

        I added the 6 volt battery system wired in series to allow more electrical storage for when dry camping.

        Ramp door patio system - the ramp door turns into a party deck, or a great place to contain pets.

        Extended season cold weather package with heated underbelly. This is great for spring and fall when the temps are warm during the day but cold at night.

        LED lights everywhere, including underneath the RV to create a cool night time lighting effect.

        King Bed option - We have it configured for a queen bed, but you can easily convert it to a king bed if you prefer. The king mattress is brand new and included.

        30 gallon fuel station to gas up your toys.

        More upgrades listed on the MSRP sheet that I have attached.

        I'm also including the Equalizer sway control hitch setup that you will need to tow this unit. I paid about $800 for that.
